--  SECTION A — SET OPERATORS
-- ============================================================

-- Q1.
-- The marketing team wants a single contact list of everyone in the system
-- — both staff members and customers.
-- Build a unified list showing full name and email for all of them.
-- Make sure no one is accidentally listed twice.

-- Q2.
-- The logistics team wants to know which states have BOTH
-- a store location AND customers living there.
-- Find those states.
SELECT state

-- in the year 2018.
-- Find the store_ids that appear in sales.stores but did NOT
-- receive any orders in 2018.

-- Q4.
-- The pricing team wants to flag overpriced products.
-- For each category, find all products whose list_price is
-- higher than the average list_price of their own category.
-- Show category_id, product_name, list_price, and the category average.

-- Q6.
-- The finance team needs a yearly performance report per store.

--  SECTION C — CONSTRAINTS (DDL)
-- ============================================================

-- Q7.
-- The business wants to launch a customer loyalty program.
-- Below is the table structure. Your job is to add the correct constraints:
--   - Each card must have a unique card number (not auto-generated).
--   - The card must be linked to a valid customer in sales.customers.
--   - Points balance cannot be negative.
--   - Tier must be one of: 'Bronze', 'Silver', or 'Gold'.
--   - Join date is required and cannot be empty.
--   - If a customer is deleted, their loyalty card record should also be deleted.
--
-- Starter table (add your constraints here):
--
 CREATE TABLE sales.loyalty_cards (
     card_number   INT	PRIMARY KEY,
     customer_id   INT	NOT NULL,
     points        INT	CHECK(points>=0),
     tier          VARCHAR(10) CHECK(TIER IN('Bronze','Silver','Gold')),
     join_date     DATE NOT NULL
 

 CONSTRAINT FK_loyalty_cards_customer
	  FOREIGN KEY (CUSTOMER_ID)
	  REFERENCES SALES.CUSTOMERS(CUSTOMER_ID)
	  ON DELETE CASCADE

);
--
-- Once the table is created, run these inserts to verify your constraints work:
--
 INSERT INTO sales.loyalty_cards VALUES (1001, 1,  500,  'Gold',   '2024-01-15');
 INSERT INTO sales.loyalty_cards VALUES (1002, 2,  150,  'Silver', '2024-03-22');
 INSERT INTO sales.loyalty_cards VALUES (1003, 3,  0,    'Bronze', '2024-06-01');
--
-- Also try these to confirm your constraints REJECT bad data:
 INSERT INTO sales.loyalty_cards VALUES (1001, 4,  100,  'Gold',   '2024-07-01'); -- duplicate card_number
 INSERT INTO sales.loyalty_cards VALUES (1004, 1,  -50,  'Silver', '2024-08-01'); -- negative points
 INSERT INTO sales.loyalty_cards VALUES (1005, 5,  200,  'Diamond','2024-09-01'); -- invalid tier



-- Q8.
-- The operations team realized that some orders in the database have
-- a shipped_date that is earlier than the order_date, which is impossible.
-- Add a rule to the table below that prevents this from happening.
-- Then try inserting a valid row and an invalid row to confirm it works.
--
-- Run this setup first:
--
 CREATE TABLE test_orders (
     order_id      INT PRIMARY KEY,
     order_date    DATE NOT NULL,
     shipped_date  DATE
 );

 INSERT INTO test_orders VALUES (1, '2024-01-10', '2024-01-13');
 INSERT INTO test_orders VALUES (2, '2024-02-05', '2024-02-07');
 INSERT INTO test_orders VALUES (3, '2024-03-01', NULL);
--
-- Now add the constraint using ALTER TABLE (do not recreate the table).

ALTER TABLE TEST_ORDERS
ADD CONSTRAINT CHK_SHIPPEDDATE
CHECK (
SHIPPED_DATE>=ORDER_DATE
)

-- After adding it, test with:
 INSERT INTO test_orders VALUES (4, '2024-04-10', '2024-04-08'); -- should FAIL
 INSERT INTO test_orders VALUES (5, '2024-04-10', '2024-04-15'); -- should PASS

--  SECTION D — CASE EXPRESSIONS
-- ============================================================

-- Q9.
-- The sales team wants to see how quickly each order was shipped.
-- Using the difference between shipped_date and order_date:
--   - 'Fast'     — shipped within 2 days
--   - 'Normal'   — shipped in 3 to 5 days
--   - 'Delayed'  — shipped after 5 days
--   - 'Pending'  — not yet shipped (shipped_date is NULL)
-- Show order_id, order_date, shipped_date, and shipping_speed.
SELECT order_id, order_date, REQUIRed_date AS Shipped_date, 
CASE 
 WHEN (DAY(SHIPPED_DATE)-DAY(REQUIRED_DATE))>=0 AND (DAY(SHIPPED_DATE)-DAY(REQUIRED_DATE))<=2 THEN 'FAST'
 WHEN (DAY(SHIPPED_DATE)-DAY(REQUIRED_DATE))>=3 AND (DAY(SHIPPED_DATE)-DAY(REQUIRED_DATE))<=5 THEN 'NORMAL'
 WHEN (DAY(SHIPPED_DATE)-DAY(REQUIRED_DATE))>5  THEN 'DELAYED'
 ELSE 'PENDING'
END AS Shipping_speed
FROM SALES.ORDERS



-- Q10.
-- The warehouse team wants to label stock levels for each product per store.
-- Using production.stocks:
--   - 'Out of Stock'  — quantity = 0
--   - 'Low Stock'     — quantity between 1 and 10
--   - 'Sufficient'    — quantity between 11 and 50
--   - 'Well Stocked'  — quantity above 50
-- Show store_id, product_id, quantity, and stock_status.
-- Sort by store_id, then quantity ascending.
select store_id,product_id,quantity,
case 
when quantity=0 then 'Out of Stock' 
when quantity>=1 and quantity<=10  then 'Low Stock' 
when quantity>=11 and quantity<=50  then 'Sufficient' 
when quantity>50  then 'Well Stocked' 
end as Stock_Status
from production.stocks

order by store_id,quantity
